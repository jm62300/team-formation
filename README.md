# team-formation project

The project contains three directories:
* encoder, contains the software to represent the team formation and k robust
team formation problems as a satisfiability problem expressed in CNF using
the Dimacs format;
* examples, contains several directories with some team formation problems;
* mapGeneration, contains the software used to generate random map for
modeling facility deployment problem instances.

The project is part of the paper "Partial Robustness in Team Formation: Bridging the Gap between Robustness and Resilience" by Schwind, DemiroviÄ‡, Inoue, and Lagniez (AAMAS'21).
