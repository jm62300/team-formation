This function creates a random grid of numbers based on Perlin noise
The grid has size (nb_pixels * nb_pixels), where nb_pixels is characterized by speed as follows:
speed = 1 -> nb_pixels = 128, speed = 2 -> 256, nb_pixels = , ..., speed = 5 -> nb_pixels = 2048
must set speed = 5 for best results
In the matrix there are (nb_patterns * nb_patterns) atomic "boxes" of noise
--> Note: an atomic box of Perlin noise is meaningless if zoomed in
The output of the matrix will be values ranging from 0 to domain_res
